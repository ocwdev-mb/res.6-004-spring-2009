Part I, containing chapters 1-6, is a traditional printed textbook published by Morgan Kaufman, an imprint of Elsevier. Part II, containing chapters 7-11, is available here as an open educational resource.\n\nThis textbook, an introduction to the principles and abstractions used in the design of computer systems, is an outgrowth of notes written for 6.033 *Computer System Engineering* over a period of 40-plus years. Individual chapters are also used in other EECS subjects. There is also a [web site for the current 6.033 class](http://mit.edu/6.033) with a lecture schedule that includes daily assignments, lecture notes, and lecture slides. The 6.033 class Web site also contains a thirteen-year archive of class assignments, design projects, and quizzes.",
